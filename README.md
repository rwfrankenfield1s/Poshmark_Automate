# Poshmark_Automate
 
Use pynput to control mouse.

This package came in handy as website/development is becoming smart enough to catch and stop automation.

The way I thought about getting around it was by automating on a higher level.

If I use the mouse and don't get caught... how about I let the computer use the mouse to not get caught...

Cleva girl...


There is test code inside to identify the pixles placement needed. take those cordinates and automate the  click steps.
